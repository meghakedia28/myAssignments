1. Write a single sql query with following information's:

a. Total number number of employees
b. Minimum salary received by any employees.

/* FROM clause */

2. Correct this query:

    FROM tblEmp E
        
/* WHERE clause */
        
3. Write a single select query which satisfies the following conditions:
    a. If any employee does not have a phone number then select that employee if ntLevel  equal to 1
    b. else select those employees whose ntLevel is equal to 0   
            
/*  ORDER BY clause */

4.  Write a sql query which displays those employee data first, who knows javascript.

    a. SELECT TOP(1) * FROM tblEmp 
    b. SELECT TOP(SELECT 3/2) * FROM tblEmp 
    c. SELECT TOP(1) PERCENT * FROM tblEmp
    d. SELECT TOP(1) WITH TIES * FROM tblEmp ORDER BY vcName
        
/* GROUP BY/HAVING I know we did not discuss this, but do if you can!*/

6. When I executed this query:
           
   SELECT [vcName],[vcMobieNumer] FROM [dbo].[tblEmp] GROUP BY [vcName]
           
    I got following error message:
    Column 'dbo.tblEmp.vcMobieNumer' is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.
